## üéØ Project title
Personal Learning Tracker (PLT): A Comprehensive Tool for Managing Courses and Assignments
This title reflects the application's purpose of helping students efficiently manage their educational activities across various platforms and institutions.

---

## üìù Project overview

The Personal Learning Tracker (PLT) is a web-based application designed to assist students in managing and tracking their courses, assignments, and class schedules from multiple universities and online platforms. In Finland, where students can enroll in courses from various institutions such as MOOC.FI, FITECH, EDX, and Coursera, it can be challenging to keep track of all course schedules and assignment deadlines in one place.
The PLT provides a centralized platform where students can input, view, and manage all course-related activities efficiently. By offering features such as course management, assignment tracking, and a visual calendar, the application aims to enhance students' organizational skills, improve time management, and ultimately support their academic success.
The target users include exchange students, local university students, and part-time learners who juggle multiple courses and responsibilities. The PLT is designed to simplify their educational experience, making it easier to stay on top of deadlines and manage their learning journey effectively.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and Future Work

At first, creating the home, courses, calendar, and profile pages worked well and set a solid foundation for the application. However, I faced challenges with the database; while the structure I created can function, there are issues when attempting to retrieve the saved data. Additionally, migrating the database to Azure PostgreSQL presented challenges, particularly in optimizing the structure to better save and retrieve JSON data.

Currently, the application serves as my personal learning tracker. In the future, I plan to add registration and login functionality to allow other users to access the platform.
