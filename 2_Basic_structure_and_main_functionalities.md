This setup allows the application to handle multiple users and requests efficiently in a production environment.
- Database Schema: The database schema consists of several key tables that define the structure of the data. The primary tables include:
  - Courses Table:
    - id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each course.
    - name: The name of the course (string).
    - course_link: A URL link associated with the course (string).
    - study_hours: The estimated number of hours required to complete the course (integer).
    - created_at: Timestamp indicating when the course was created (timestamp).
    - updated_at: Timestamp indicating when the course was last updated (timestamp).
  - Assignments Table:
    - id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each assignment (integer).
    - course_id (Foreign Key): References the id of the associated course (integer).
    - name: The name of the assignment (string).
    - due_date: The deadline for submitting the assignment (date).
    - is_completed: A boolean indicating whether the assignment has been completed (boolean).
    - created_at: Timestamp indicating when the assignment was created (timestamp).
    - updated_at: Timestamp indicating when the assignment was last updated (timestamp).
- Relationships: The Assignments table has a foreign key relationship with the Courses table through the course_id field. This relationship allows for the association of multiple assignments with a single course, enabling efficient data retrieval and management.

```javascript
/**
 * Toggles the completion status of an assignment
 * @param {number} assignmentId - The ID of the assignment to update
 * @param {boolean} currentStatus - The current completion status
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - A promise that resolves when the update is complete
 */
const toggleAssignmentCompletion = async (assignmentId, currentStatus) => {
    try {
        // Update the local state optimistically for better UX
        const updatedCourses = courses.map(course => ({
            ...course,
            assignments: course.assignments.map(assignment => 
                assignment.id === assignmentId 
                    ? { ...assignment, is_completed: !currentStatus }
                    : assignment
            )
        }));
        setCourses(updatedCourses);
        
        // Persist the change to the backend
        await fetch(`${API_URL}/assignments/${assignmentId}`, {
            method: 'PUT',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ is_completed: !currentStatus })
        });
        
        // Store timestamp for sync purposes
        localStorage.setItem('last_update', Date.now().toString());
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error toggling assignment completion:', error);
        // Revert the optimistic update if the API call fails
        fetchCourses();
    }
};
```

#### API Documentation

Each API endpoint is documented with:
- Purpose
- Required parameters
- Response format
- Possible error conditions

```javascript
// Reusable form handling logic
const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setNewCourse({
        ...newCourse,
        [name]: name === 'study_hours' ? parseFloat(value) : value
    });
};
```

## 8. Testing and error handling

### Database Testing with Postman

The database functionality of the Self-Learning Tracker application was thoroughly tested using Postman, a popular API testing tool. This approach allowed for comprehensive verification of the database operations through the application's API endpoints.

#### Test Suite Overview

A complete Postman collection was created to test all database interactions, including:

- **Connection Verification**: Testing the base endpoint (`GET /`) to confirm database connectivity
- **CRUD Operations Testing**: Verifying all Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both courses and assignments

#### Courses API Tests

- **GET /courses**: Confirmed retrieval of all courses with their associated assignments
- **POST /courses**: Validated course creation with proper data validation
- **PUT /courses/:id**: Verified course updates with appropriate error handling for invalid inputs
- **DELETE /courses/:id**: Tested cascade deletion of courses and their assignments

#### Assignments API Tests

- **GET /assignments**: Verified retrieval of all assignments across courses
- **GET /courses/:id/assignments**: Confirmed fetching assignments for a specific course
- **POST /assignments**: Tested assignment creation with validation for required fields
- **PUT /assignments/:id**: Validated updating assignment completion status
- **DELETE /assignments/:id**: Confirmed proper removal of assignments

#### Error Handling Tests

The Postman tests also verified error handling for various scenarios:

- **Invalid Input**: Tested API responses for missing or invalid fields
- **Resource Not Found**: Confirmed appropriate 404 responses for non-existent resources
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Verified handling of relationships between courses and assignments

#### Test Results Documentation

All test results were documented in a structured format:

| Endpoint | Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| GET /courses | Retrieve all courses | 200 OK with courses array | 200 OK with courses array | PASS |
| POST /courses | Create with invalid study hours | 400 Bad Request | 400 Bad Request | PASS |
| PUT /courses/1 | Update course name | 200 OK with updated course | 200 OK with updated course | PASS |
| DELETE /courses/999 | Delete non-existent course | 404 Not Found | 404 Not Found | PASS |

#### Automated Testing Implementation

Postman tests were automated using collection runners and integrated into the development workflow:

```javascript
// Example Postman test script for GET /courses endpoint
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response is an array", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(Array.isArray(jsonData)).to.be.true;
});

pm.test("Courses have required fields", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    if (jsonData.length > 0) {
        pm.expect(jsonData[0]).to.have.property('id');
        pm.expect(jsonData[0]).to.have.property('name');
        pm.expect(jsonData[0]).to.have.property('study_hours');
        pm.expect(jsonData[0]).to.have.property('assignments');
    }
});
```
## 8. Testing and Error Handling

The Self-Learning Tracker application incorporates comprehensive testing and robust error handling across all layers of the application. Three primary testing methodologies were implemented to ensure reliability, functionality, and performance: Unit Testing, End-to-End Testing, and Load Testing.

### 8.1 Repository Organization

All tests have been organized and added to the frontend GitHub repository at [https://github.com/supaizjy0321/courses-frontend](https://github.com/supaizjy0321/courses-frontend). 

This structure keeps tests organized by type, making it easy to run specific test suites as needed and maintain separation of concerns.

### 8.2 Unit Testing with React & Vitest

Unit tests were implemented to verify the correct functioning of individual React components in isolation. This approach ensures that each component behaves as expected regardless of the surrounding application context.

#### Component Tests

Several core components were tested, including:

- **Sidebar Component**: Tests verify that navigation links for "Courses" and "Calendar" are correctly rendered and accessible.

```javascript
test('renders navigation links correctly', () => {
  render(
    <MemoryRouter>
      <Sidebar />
    </MemoryRouter>
  );
  
  const coursesLink = screen.getByText(/Courses/i);
  expect(coursesLink).toBeInTheDocument();
  
  const calendarLink = screen.getByText(/Calendar/i);
  expect(calendarLink).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

- **CoursesPage Component**: Tests validate the display of courses, form submission for adding new courses, and proper handling of API interactions.

```javascript
test('displays courses after fetching data', async () => {
  render(<CoursesPage />);
  
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText(/Math 101/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  expect(screen.getByText(/2.5 hours/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText(/Homework1/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

These unit tests ensure that components render correctly, handle user interactions appropriately, and manage state effectively.

### 8.3 End-to-End Testing with Playwright

End-to-End (E2E) tests were implemented to verify the application's functionality from a user's perspective, testing complete workflows across the entire application.

#### Testing Configuration

Playwright was configured to simulate user interactions in a browser environment, allowing for comprehensive testing of the application's UI and integration points.

#### User Flow Tests

E2E tests cover critical user flows:

- **Navigation Test**: Validates that users can navigate between different pages of the application using the sidebar menu.

```typescript
test('navigation between pages works correctly', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(appUrl);
  
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Courses App/);
  
  await page.click('text=Courses');
  await expect(page.locator('h2')).toContainText('Courses');
  
  await page.click('text=Calendar');
  await expect(page.locator('h2')).toContainText('Calendar');
});
```

- **Course Management Test**: Verifies the end-to-end process of adding and deleting a course, ensuring that the UI updates correctly and data persists.

```typescript
test('can add and then delete a course', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(appUrl);
  await page.click('text=Courses');
  
  const courseName = `Test Course ${Date.now()}`;
  await page.fill('input[placeholder="Course name"]', courseName);
  await page.fill('input[placeholder="Study hours"]', '3');
  
  await page.click('button:has-text("Add Course")');
  await page.waitForSelector(`text=${courseName}`);
  
  const courseElement = page.locator(`text=${courseName}`).first();
  await expect(courseElement).toBeVisible();
  
  // Delete verification
  const courseItem = courseElement.locator('..').locator('..');
  await courseItem.locator('button:has-text("Delete")').click();
  await expect(page.locator(`text=${courseName}`)).toHaveCount(0);
});
```

These E2E tests confirm that the application functions correctly as a whole, with all components working together to provide a seamless user experience.

### 8.4 Load Testing with K6

Load testing was implemented to verify the performance and scalability of the backend API under various levels of user traffic.

#### Testing Configuration

K6, a modern load testing tool, was configured to simulate multiple concurrent users accessing the application's API endpoints.

#### Performance Tests

Two main load testing scenarios were implemented:

- **API Endpoint Performance**: Tests the response time and reliability of GET endpoints under load.

```javascript
export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '30s', target: 20 }, // Ramp up to 20 users
    { duration: '1m', target: 20 },  // Stay at 20 users
    { duration: '30s', target: 0 },  // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'], // 95% under 500ms
  },
};

export default function () {
  const coursesResponse = http.get(`${API_URL}/courses`);
  
  check(coursesResponse, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response has courses': (r) => r.json().length > 0,
  });
  
  // Additional endpoint tests...
  sleep(1);
}
```

- **Course Creation Under Load**: Tests the ability of the system to handle multiple concurrent write operations.

```javascript
export const options = {
  vus: 5, // 5 virtual users
  iterations: 10, // Each user performs 10 iterations
};

export default function () {
  const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
  const courseName = `Load Test Course ${timestamp}`;
  
  const createResponse = http.post(`${API_URL}/courses`, 
    JSON.stringify({
      name: courseName,
      course_link: 'https://example.com/load-test',
      study_hours: 2
    }), 
    { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
  );
  
  check(createResponse, {
    'status is 200 or 201': (r) => r.status === 200 || r.status === 201,
  });
  
  // Verification tests...
}
```

The load tests confirmed that the application's backend can handle multiple concurrent users with acceptable response times, ensuring a smooth experience even under increased load.

### 8.5 Error Handling Implementation

Comprehensive error handling was implemented across all layers of the application:

- **Frontend Error Handling**: React components include try-catch blocks around API calls, with appropriate UI feedback for error states.

```javascript
try {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/courses`);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
  }
  const data = await response.json();
  setCourses(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error fetching courses:', error);
  setError('Failed to load courses. Please try again later.');
}
```

- **Backend Error Handling**: Express routes implement proper error catching and appropriate HTTP status codes.

```javascript
app.get('/courses', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const result = await pool.query(/* SQL query */);
    res.json(result.rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching courses:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
});
```

- **Database Error Handling**: SQL queries are wrapped in try-catch blocks with specific error types identified and handled appropriately.

### 8.6 Test Results and Analysis

All three testing methodologies provided valuable insights:

- **Unit Tests**: All component tests passed successfully, confirming the correct functioning of individual parts of the application.

- **E2E Tests**: The Playwright tests verified that the application functions correctly from a user perspective, with all workflows completing as expected.

- **Load Tests**: K6 tests confirmed that the API can handle the expected load with response times well within acceptable thresholds. The 95th percentile response time remained under 500ms even with 20 concurrent users.

### Frontend Error Handling

The React frontend employs several error handling mechanisms:

1. **API Request Error Handling**: All fetch requests are wrapped in try-catch blocks to gracefully handle network failures and unexpected server responses.

```javascript
// Example from CoursesPage.jsx
const fetchCourses = async () => {
  try {
    setIsLoading(true);
    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/courses`);
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch courses');
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    setCourses(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching courses:', error);
    setError('Unable to load courses. Please try again later.');
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

2. **User Feedback**: Error states are stored in component state and displayed to users with contextual messages that avoid technical jargon.

3. **Form Validation**: Input validation prevents submission of invalid data, with clear error messages guiding users to correct issues.

### Backend Error Handling

The Express.js backend implements several error handling patterns:

1. **Request Validation**: Input data is validated before processing, with appropriate HTTP 400 responses for invalid requests.

```javascript
// Example from server.js
app.post('/courses', async (req, res) => {
  const { name, study_hours } = req.body;

  if (!name || study_hours === undefined) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Name and study hours are required' });
  }
  
  if (study_hours < 0) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Study hours cannot be negative' });
  }
  
  // Continue with database operation...
});
```

2. **Database Error Classification**: Database errors are classified by type and translated into appropriate HTTP responses.

```javascript
try {
  // Database operation...
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error creating course:', error);
  
  if (error.code === '23505') { // Unique constraint violation
    return res.status(409).json({ error: 'A course with this name already exists' });
  }
  
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
}
```

3. **Error Logging**: All errors are logged with contextual information to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

### Database Error Handling

At the database layer, several strategies ensure data integrity and reliability:

1. **Connection Management**: The connection pool implements error handling for connection issues.

```javascript
pool.on('error', (err, client) => {
  console.error('Unexpected error on idle client', err);
});
```

2. **Transaction Safety**: Critical operations use transactions to prevent partial updates in case of errors.

3. **Parameterized Queries**: All SQL queries use parameterization to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### Global Error Handling

The application also implements system-wide error handling:

1. **Unhandled Promise Rejections**: Global handlers catch any unhandled promise rejections.

2. **404 Route**: A catch-all route handler provides a consistent response for undefined routes.

```javascript
// Last route in the Express app
app.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).json({ error: 'Endpoint not found' });
});
```
## 9. User Interface and Interaction

Navigation elements use familiar icons and clear labels, making the interface immediately understandable even for first-time users.

### 9.3 Course Management Interface

The Courses page presents a user-friendly interface for managing learning materials:

- **Course Cards**: Each course is displayed in a card format with key information (name, study hours, assignment count) immediately visible
- **Expandable Details**: Cards expand to show assignments and additional details when selected
- **Inline Actions**: Edit and delete buttons are contextually placed near the relevant content
- **Add Course Form**: Simple, focused form with clear input fields and validation feedback

### 9.4 Assignment Tracking

The application provides visual tools for tracking assignments:

- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges show completion status at a glance
- **Due Date Formatting**: Dates are displayed in a user-friendly format with approaching deadlines highlighted
- **Sorting Options**: Assignments can be sorted by due date or course
- **Completion Toggle**: One-click checkbox interface for marking assignments complete

### 9.5 Calendar View

The Calendar page offers a visual representation of the user's schedule:
