# PersonalLearningTracker

## Project Overview
### **Project Name:** Personal Learning Tracker (PLT)

### **Objective:**
The Personal Learning Tracker (PLT) is a web-based application designed to help students manage and track courses, assignments, and class schedules from multiple universities and online platforms. In Finland, since students can enroll in courses from different universities and platforms like MOOC.FI, FITECH, EDX, and Coursera, it becomes difficult to track all course schedules and assignment deadlines in one place. PLT provides a centralized platform where students can input and view all course-related activities efficiently.

### **Key Features**
- **Course Management:** Add, edit, delete courses from different universities and platforms.
- **Assignment & Deadline Tracking:** Input assignments and deadlines.
- **Calendar View:** Display upcoming deadlines and class schedules in a weekly/monthly format.
